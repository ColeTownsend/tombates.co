          <p class="u-text-large">I'm a recent graduate from Central St Martins where I studied graphic design. Currently I work as a hybrid designer at <a href="http://ustwo.com">ustwo</a>. For me, what I do is not just about making a project look visually attractive, but shaping exactly how and why it functions in the way it does. It's lead me to naturally develop an extremely iterative process that usually involves a lot of rapid prototyping <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; I find the majority of what I learn about a problem and it's solution comes from building quick prototypes #bigfan</span>.</p>

          <p class="u-text-large">I love learning about new things. I decided it was time to be proactive about it and &ndash; you know &ndash; learn some stuff. So, I'm learning Portuguese very slowly, going to more talks about design/tech and trying to pick up some new skills along the way <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; maybe even make my own typeface.</span></p>

          <p class="u-text-large">I'm always up for a side project, collaboration or the odd freelance project. So if you got an idea you think we could team up on <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; or just feel like a little chat &ndash;</span> give me a <a href="mailto:hey@tombates.co">shout</a>.</p>

          <p class="u-text--grey info-short">P.S. Writing these things sucks. Oooo, almost forgot. The photo was taken in Rio earlier this year. <span class="u-text--orange">&ndash; noiceâ„¢.</span></p>
